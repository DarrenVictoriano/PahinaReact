# React App: Pahina

This react app serves as my portfolio as well as my personal blog. Under the hood this app lets me sign-in my account and post a blog that will show up on the "Blog" page.

Note: Pahina means Page in _Tagalog._

## Features:
1. __Portfolio:__ this is a single page app that showcases my portfolio.
2.  __Blog:__ a blog that renders Markdownsyntax. When I'm signed-in I can write a content while seeing a live view of the rendered markdown for easy editing and posting.

### Thanks to these Dependencies:
* [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - for sending request to my server.
* [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - I'm so used to using built-in classes from react, made my life easier creating a grid.
* [react-moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moment) - this is what I used to parse the time format
* [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/) - basically bootstrap into react components.
* [react-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie) - I used this to save my token.
* [react-helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-helmet) - hah, I just realized its so hard to change the HTML Body's background color with react. So I had to use this  ðŸ¤£
* [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) - for easy routing using hooks.
* [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) - this is what I used to render Markdown!
* [react-syntax-highlighter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-syntax-highlighter) - syntax highlighter for Markdown!
* [react-textarea-autosize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-textarea-autosize) - you don't really see this unless you're me but this is really cool, instead of having a scroll bar, this will expand your text-area instead.
